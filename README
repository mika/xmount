1.0 What is xmount? - A short description
  xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input and output
  image types. xmount creates a virtual file system using FUSE (Filesystem in
  Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of the input image. The
  virtual representation can be in raw DD or in VirtualBox's virtual disk file
  format. Input images can be raw DD or EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format)
  files. In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output
  files that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it for example possible
  to use VirtualBox to boot an OS contained in a read-only EWF image.

2.0 A deeper view of things
  2.1 Emulated DD file
    This is the standard data representation used by xmount. It is a file
    containing the raw data contained in the input image file.

  2.2 Emulated VDI file
    When using the "--out vdi" command line parameter, a VirtualBox disk file
    is emulated. This means that xmount builds a virtual VDI header and prepends
    it to the raw data contained in the input image. The VDI file can be used in
    VirtualBox as a virtual disk file. This makes it possible to access data
    from image files in a virtual machine.

  2.3 Emulated VMDK file
    When using the "--out vmdk(s)" command line paramter, a VMWare virtual disk
    file will be emulated. This mainly consists in building a VMDK descriptor
    file that will access an emulated DD file. You can use this VMDK file to
    add your input image as virtual disk to a VMWare virtual machine.

    When emulating VMDK files to be used in VMWare, you have to enable
    "user_allow_other" in /etc/fuse.conf and use the -o allow_other command
    line parameter.

    WARNING: VMDK support should be considered experimental and currently the
             VMDK descriptor file isn't cached.

  2.4 Virtual write access
    By using the "--rw <cache_file>" command line parameter, xmount allows you
    to write data to the emulated image files. All changes are written to a
    separate cache file. No data will ever be written to the input image files.
    Write access is limited to change existing data only. It isn't possible to
    change the emulated image's file size! (No append or truncate)

3.0 Installation instructions
  To install xmount, you can use a prebuild package for your distribution or
  you can build xmount from source. The two methods are described in the
  following sections.

  3.1 Prerequisits
    FUSE:
      Your linux distribution must support FUSE and have the apropiate libraries
      installed. (See http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ for more informations). To be
      able to install from source, you also need the FUSE header files.
    LIBEWF: (If you want to have EWF input image support)
      You must have installed libewf. To install from source, you also need the
      appropriate header files. (See https://www.uitwisselplatform.nl/projects/
      libewf/ for more informations)

  3.2 Install from a package
    Chances are I provide prebuild binary packages for OpenBSD (No EWF and AFF
    support), Slackware, Debian and Ubuntu. In this case, you only have to fire
    up your distribution's package manager and install xmount. See
    http://www.pinguin.lu for more informations and download links.

  3.3 Install from source
    After having checked the prerequisits, you should be able to compile and
    install xmount by simply issuing the followng three commands:

    # ./configure
    # make
    # make install

4.0 xmount command line parameters
  xmount [[fopts] [mopts]] <ifile> [<ifile> [...]] <mntp>

  fopts:
    -d : Enable FUSE's and xmount's debug mode.
    -s : Run single threaded.
    -o <fmopts> : Specify fuse mount options.
    INFO: For VMDK emulation, you have to uncomment "user_allow_other" in
          /etc/fuse.conf and use the -o allow_root command line parameter.
  mopts:
    --in <itype> : Input image format. <itype> can be "dd", "ewf".
    --info : Print out some infos about used compiler and libraries.
    --out <otype> : Output image format. <otype> can be "dd", "vdi", "vmdk".
    --rw <cache_file> : Enable virtual write support and set cache file to use.
    --version : Same as --info.
    INFO: Input and output image type defaults to "dd" if not specified.
  ifile:
    Input image file. If you use EWF files, you have to specify all image
    segments!
  mntp:
    Mount point where virtual files should be located.

  4.1 xmount usage examples
    To xmount an EWF image from your acquired disk as a raw DD image under /mnt,
    use the following command:

      xmount --in ewf ./acquired_disk.E?? /mnt

    To xmount the same ewf image as vdi file, you would use a command like this:

      xmount --in ewf --output vdi ./acquired_disk.E?? /mnt

    And to enable virtual write support on a raw DD input image xmounted as VDI
    file:

      xmount --out vdi --rw ./acquired_disk.cache ./acquired_disk.dd /mnt
